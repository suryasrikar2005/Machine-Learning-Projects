##📘 Project - 1: Medical Cost Prediction – Insurance Charges Estimator
This project predicts medical insurance charges using a person's demographics and lifestyle information by applying Multiple Linear Regression. It demonstrates how regression models can help insurance companies estimate risk and cost more accurately.

 🧠 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of patient details (age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region), the goal is to predict the **medical insurance cost** a person might incur.
