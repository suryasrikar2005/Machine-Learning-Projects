# 📘 Project - 1: Medical Cost Prediction – Insurance Charges Estimator
This project predicts medical insurance charges using a person's demographics and lifestyle information by applying Multiple Linear Regression. It demonstrates how regression models can help insurance companies estimate risk and cost more accurately.

 🧠 Problem Statement
Given a dataset of patient details (age, sex, BMI, number of children, smoking status, region), the goal is to predict the **medical insurance cost** a person might incur.

# 🚢 Project - 2: Titanic Survival Prediction Project
This project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on features such as age, gender, class, and fare. It is a classic beginner ML project, and this version achieves an accuracy of 59%.

📌 Project Overview
Goal: Predict survival of passengers aboard the Titanic.

Dataset: Titanic dataset from Kaggle or sklearn (contains passenger features and survival labels).

Model Accuracy: 59% (initial baseline).
